// coop/props/trash_mirror.h -- the client's mirror of a trash entity, in either form, as the
// GAME's own actor with its brain parked.
//
// A rooted runtime actorChipPile_C or prop_garbageClump_C: GC-pinned, tick off, physics off, root
// movable, skinned from the host's chip type through the actor's own init, and bound as the
// element's mirror marked save-native, so it rides the same machinery as a save-loaded native.
// A real actor is what the game's look-at trace accepts, so the hover prompt, collision,
// occlusion and per-instance rotation are the game's.
//
// What makes keeping the game's actor safe is coop/props/trash_morph_gate, which refuses the
// three verbs a trash actor uses to author its own morph; tick-off alone would leave those bodies
// reachable. A clump additionally has its collision off for its whole life, carried and in
// flight -- the pile it lands as is a fresh actor with the game's own collision. GAME-THREAD only.
