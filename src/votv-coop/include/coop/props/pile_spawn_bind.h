// The pile SPAWN-TIME native-bind mechanism.
//
// A joiner's world comes from the host's save, so the pile a host expression names is one the
// client already owns, at the same position. This resolves the expression against the client's
// OWN save-loaded native chipPile set -- through a lazily-built bracket-scoped GUObjectArray
// index rather than one walk per pile -- and binds that actor as the host eid's mirror, so the
// client keeps the game's own pile with its collision, its hover prompt and its look-at trace
// (docs/piles.md).
//
// This is the SPAWN-time half only, driven by remote_prop_spawn during a PropSpawn;
// the DRAIN-time half -- the deferred queues this arms and the ordered sweep that
// drains them -- belongs to coop/element/quiescence_drain.h, the order owner.
//
// Game-thread ONLY (the event_feed drain), no mutex: the same contract as the
// claim set it reads. `claimed` (remote_prop_spawn's g_claimedActors) is read-only.

// the world-ready snapshot burst runs BEFORE the client's async native-pile load tail has
// drained, so the native at that position may not exist yet at this call and appears in the tail
