// harness/autotest/broomstroke.h -- the broom-stroke drill's own declaration.
//
// Beside its implementation rather than in harness/autotest.h, whose catalogue carries a paragraph
// per drill and has reached the length at which a declaration file counts as an essay. A drill is
// one feature; this is where its interface belongs.
//
// It measures a whole broom stroke, swung through the broom's own right mouse button on a broom each
// peer really holds, followed on both peers by element id: each peer holding the button, the host
// sweeping a heap and the client a lone pile, the client emptying a dispenser, each peer pushing the
// trash, and on the heap's floor two clumps held back from re-piling, one knocked up and one pushed
// again. A two-peer driver joins the two logs. Env VOTVCOOP_RUN_BROOM_STROKE=1, on both peers.
