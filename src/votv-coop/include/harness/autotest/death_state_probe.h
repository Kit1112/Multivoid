// harness/autotest/death_state_probe.h -- one game-thread reading of everything the death chain
// touches, and the four censuses that name a source a targeted read cannot find.
//
// Extracted from autotest_death.cpp when that file reached 1088 lines: READING the death state
// and DRIVING a death are two concerns, and the readers had already grown a second consumer --
// autotest_runend.cpp re-derived the ragdoll flags, the location and the KPP distance by hand.
// A third (the banana drill) needed the same. The drills own their own threading; this module
// owns the reads, and every entry point here must be called ON the game thread.
